# AutomationDemo


In my QA Automation background. I use TestNG framework with JAVA. 
To write automation scripts. I even included a chromedriver file which will start the browser
Please not this was written assuming the user is using a MAC OS. The files are in automation.test package.
I used Eclipse IDE to run right click on test/src/test/java/automaion/test/SauceLabsDemo.java and select Run as TestNG 


I used TestNG all the separate functions are executed in order of the test
